<h1><b>Version 1.0</b></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thanks for trying GymCalc :)</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially when working with barbells, it is not obvious what plates you should be adding to the bar to
    get the total weight you want, especially once you start doing pyramid or reverse pyramid training. GymCalc solves
    that problem for you.</p>

<p>I made GymCalc partly as an exercise in mobile app development, but it was also something I wanted for myself. I'd
    already built the core features about 5 years ago using JavaScript. I had tried a number of different apps that
    supposedly do these types of calculations, and didn't like any of them. So I built GymCalc and ran it in a web
    browser on my phone.</p>

<h2>Reverse Pyramid Training</h2>

<p>One popular technique often used when lifting weights is called "reverse pyramid training", or
    RPT. A typical pattern for this technique starts with 2-3 warm-up sets, as usual, with a low number of reps
    (about 5). These serve to get blood into the muscles, establish the mind-muscle connection, and provide an
    opportunity to review your technique. Rest for 1 minute between warm-up sets.</p>

<p>Then you perform your 3 working sets. Start with your heaviest (or goal) weight, and perform as many reps as
    possible (AMRAP). Then you drop the weight by about 10% and again do AMRAP. Repeat for the 3rd working set.
    Rest for about 2 minutes before each working set.</p>

<p>So, as an example, let's say your goal for squats in a particular session is to perform 6 reps of 100 kg. Your
    warm-up sets would be performed with, say, 50kg and 60kg. Then your working sets would be  performed with 100kg,
    90kg, and 80kg.</p>

<p>To use the app to determine the best plates to put on the bar, specify the goal weight (the 100% weight), select
    the bar weight, and press "Calculate". The app will tell you what plates to choose that will give the total
    closest to 100%, 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of the goal weight. (I am assuming for now that it would be unusual for
    people to want lower percentages than this, but if people ask, I can easily add that. I may make the percentages
    customisable in the future.)</p>

<h2>Other techniques</h2>

<p>As you probably know or guessed, reverse pyramid training suggests "regular" pyramid training. With pyramid
    training, we <i>increase</i> the weight for each working set. If you want to use this technique, just perform
    warm-up sets at 50% and 60% of the maximum weight, and working sets at 80%, 90%, and 100%.</p>

<p>You can also use the app to do drop sets. This is often the last set for a muscle group within a session, and is
    intended to "finish off" (i.e. maximally fatigue) the muscles. In a drop set, you do AMRAP at a given weight, then
    remove, say 10-20% of the weight, immediately do AMRAP again (with no rest), and so on, until you either run out of
    weight, can't move your arms or legs any more, vomit, or basically die.
    You can also use the app to help with drop sets, but I wouldn't take too long messing around with swapping plates or
    it isn't really a drop set anymore. It's a technique better suited to dumbbells and pin-loaded machines.
    A more basic form of the drop set is to do AMRAP at a given weight, then drop it by 50% and do AMRAP again, then
    stop.</p>

<h2>Weights</h2>

<p>I've included the usual weights for bars, plates, and dumbbells found in most gyms (at least, most gyms in
    Australia). Regarding bar weights, 20kg is the standard and by far the most common, although some gyms may also have
    15kg or 25kg bars. EZ-curl bars are less standardised and usually in the 7.5-10kg range. In a future version I will
    allow users to enter custom bar (and other) weights.</p>

<p>Most gyms don't have so-called "micro" or fractional plates (those in the 0.25-1kg range), but they
    can be helpful when you only want to increase your goal weight by an incremental amount. They're pretty
    cheap. You can take them to the gym with you and simply enable these weights in the app.</p>

<p>Most gyms seem to have a set of smaller dumbbells in the range 1-10kg, and a set of larger ones in the range
    2.5-50kg, and this is what I've enabled by default. However, if your gym has different ones, please let me
    know. As mentioned, I'm planning to make it possible to add and remove weights in a future version.</p>

<p>Yes: if you want to use the app with kettlebells, for now you can just use the dumbbell option. If you want a
    dedicated kettlebell option, please let me know.</p>

<h2>Plate colours</h2>

<p>The plate colours come from standard plate colours for Olympic bumper plates (which most gyms have), plus a couple of
    other colours for non-standard weights. I've made multiples of 10 the same colour, even though they are usually
    something else in reality.</p>

<h2>Future enhancements</h2>

<p>I have a handful of new features planned to build when I can.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Android version</li>
    <li>Support for plates in US units (lbs)</li>
    <li>Support for plate-loaded machines</li>
    <li>Custom weights for bars, plates, and dumbbells</li>
</ul>
