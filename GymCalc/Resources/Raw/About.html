<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Thanks for trying GymCalc :)</p>

<p>Sometimes, especially when working with barbells, it is not obvious what plates you should be adding to the bar to
    get the total weight you want, especially once you start doing pyramid or reverse pyramid training. GymCalc solves
    that problem for you.</p>

<p>Review the Instructions to learn how to use the app.</p>

<p>I'd love to hear of any improvements you would like to see or bugs you encounter. Please feel welcome to contact me
    at shaun@astromultimedia.com.</p>

<p>I'm especially interested at this time to know what weights are usually found in gyms in countries other than
    Australia, if they differ from the defaults I've set up.</p>

<h2>Weights</h2>

<p>I've included the usual weights for bars, plates, and dumbbells found in most gyms (at least, most gyms in
    Australia). Regarding bar weights, 20kg is the standard and by far the most common, although some gyms may also have
    15kg or 25kg bars. EZ-curl bars are less standardised and usually in the 7.5-10kg range.</p>

<p>Most gyms don't have so-called "micro" or fractional plates (those in the 0.25-1 kg/lb range), but they can be
    helpful when you only want to increase the weight by a small amount. With this app, they can be very helpful for
    getting closer to the ideal weight.</p>

<p>I haven't taken into consideration weights of dumbbell bars, as this is highly variable.</p>

<h2>Colours</h2>

<p>The colours for plates come from the standard colours for Olympic bumper plates. For kettlebells, official
    competition colours have been used. Other colours have been used for non-standard weights. For plates, I've made
    multiples of 10 the same colour. You can modify the colours as you please to suit the weights in your gym.</p>
