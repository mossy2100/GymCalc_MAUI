<h2>Using the calculator</h2>

<p><b>Step 1:</b> Select the exercise type.</p>

<p><b>Step 2:</b> Enter the maximum weight you're going for.</p>

<p><b>Step 3:</b></p>

<p><i>Barbell exercises:</i> Select the weight of the bar and press calculate. If you don't know the weight
of the bar, it's probably 20 kg or 45 lb.</p>

<p><i>Machine exercises:</i> Enter the starting weight of the machine. This should be shown on a metal plate fixed
    to the machine. If not, you can often look it up on the manufacturer's website, or just leave it blank (i.e. set it
    to zero); the important thing is that you do the same each time. Then check "One side only" for unilateral
    machines (where each arm or leg can move independently), or leave it unchecked for bilateral machines (where both
    arms or both legs move together).</p>

<p><i>Dumbbell or kettlebell exercises:</i> There is no step 3, carry on!</p>

<p><b>Step 4:</b> Press "Calculate". The app will then display the plates or weight you should select to get closest to
    the maximum weight you entered. The same calculation is done for 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, and 50% of the maximum.
    This is helpful for warm-up sets, drop sets, or pyramid or reverse pyramid training.</p>

<h2>Setting up your weights</h2>

<p>Although hopefully the defaults will include all the weights you have in your gym, every gym has different weights,
    and you need to set these up correctly or the app will recommend weights you don't have.</p>

<p>To enable weights that are available in your gym, or disable weights that aren't, use the flyout menu to select
    Bars, Plates, Dumbbells, or Kettlebells, then check which ones are available.</p>

<p>To add, delete, or modify weights, check the "Edit mode" checkbox, then use the buttons that appear.</p>

<h2>Reverse Pyramid Training</h2>

<p>A popular technique often used when lifting weights is called "reverse pyramid training" (RPT). This is one of the
    best uses for the app.</p>

<p>The goal of RPT is to do your heaviest set first (after your warm-up sets) when your muscles are least fatigued, to
    maximise strength gains. Then you progressively lower the weight and increase the reps, shifting focus from strength
    to hypertrophy.</p>

<p>A typical pattern for this technique starts with 2-3 warm-up sets, as usual, with a low number of
    reps per set (about 5). Rest for 1 minute between warm-up sets.</p>

<p>Then you perform your 3 working sets. Start with your heaviest (or goal) weight, and perform as many reps as
    possible (AMRAP), aiming for at least 3-6. Then you drop the weight by about 10% and again do AMRAP, aiming for
    at least 6-9 reps. Repeat for the 3rd working set, aiming for at least 9-12 reps. Rest for about 2 minutes before
    each working set.</p>

<p>So to use RPT on an exercise, you can do warm-up sets with 50% and 60%, then working sets at 100%, 90%, and 80%.</p>
